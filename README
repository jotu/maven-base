"Standard" Maven setup for Java projects.
Consists of 3 modules that configures different aspects of the Maven build. The parent/pom.xml is the pom to use a parent in most 
cases.

build-tools
-----------
Contains configuration files for different code quality tools;
 * Checkstyle
 * Findbugs
 * PMD

build-config
------------
Configures the Maven "lifecycle", sets versions of plugins to use and configures the code quality tools to run in the Maven 
lifecycle. The checking plugins configured are:
 * Checkstyle
 * Findbugs
 * PMD
 * Cobertura
 
It contains the JDK version to use and the encoding to use for java and resource files.
It also defines a profile "fast.install" that can be used to perform a fast install of a module. The profile will skip compilation 
of test sources, skip PMD check, skip Checkstyle checks and Cobertura checks.
This pom can be used as a parent pom if we want to have separate configurations and checks for different modules.
This is also the place to lock dependency [verions] that we want in the project.

parent
------
This is the pom to be used as parent in most cases. In addition to the build-configuration (which it has parent) it will verify 
which Maven version is used to build.
